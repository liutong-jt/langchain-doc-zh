# Few-shot prompt templates

在这个教程中，我们将学习如何创建一个使用few-shot样例的提示模板。few-shot提示模板可以从一组样例或Example Selector对象构建。

### 使用案例

在这个教程中，我们将为自我提问和搜索配置few-shot样例。

## 使用样例集

### 创建样例集

首先，创建一个few-shot样例的列表。每个样例应该是一个字典，键是输入变量，值是这些输入变量的值。

```python
from langchain.prompts.few_shot import FewShotPromptTemplate
from langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate

examples = [
    {
        "question": "Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?",
        "answer": """
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: How old was Muhammad Ali when he died?
Intermediate answer: Muhammad Ali was 74 years old when he died.
Follow up: How old was Alan Turing when he died?
Intermediate answer: Alan Turing was 41 years old when he died.
So the final answer is: Muhammad Ali
""",
    },
    {
        "question": "When was the founder of craigslist born?",
        "answer": """
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who was the founder of craigslist?
Intermediate answer: Craigslist was founded by Craig Newmark.
Follow up: When was Craig Newmark born?
Intermediate answer: Craig Newmark was born on December 6, 1952.
So the final answer is: December 6, 1952
""",
    },
    {
        "question": "Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?",
        "answer": """
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?
Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.
Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.
So the final answer is: Joseph Ball
""",
    },
    {
        "question": "Are both the directors of Jaws and Casino Royale from the same country?",
        "answer": """
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who is the director of Jaws?
Intermediate Answer: The director of Jaws is Steven Spielberg.
Follow up: Where is Steven Spielberg from?
Intermediate Answer: The United States.
Follow up: Who is the director of Casino Royale?
Intermediate Answer: The director of Casino Royale is Martin Campbell.
Follow up: Where is Martin Campbell from?
Intermediate Answer: New Zealand.
So the final answer is: No
""",
    },
]
```



### Create a formatter for the few-shot examples

配置一个格式化程序，将少量示例格式化为字符串。该格式化程序应该是`PromptTemplate`对象。

```python
example_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["question", "answer"], template="Question: {question}\n{answer}"
)

print(example_prompt.format(**examples[0]))
```



```text
Question: Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?

Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: How old was Muhammad Ali when he died?
Intermediate answer: Muhammad Ali was 74 years old when he died.
Follow up: How old was Alan Turing when he died?
Intermediate answer: Alan Turing was 41 years old when he died.
So the final answer is: Muhammad Ali
```



### Feed examples and formatter to `FewShotPromptTemplate`

最后，创建一个`FewShotPromptTemplate`对象。这个对象接受少量示例和少量示例的格式化程序。

```python
prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
    examples=examples,
    example_prompt=example_prompt,
    suffix="Question: {input}",
    input_variables=["input"],
)

print(prompt.format(input="Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?"))
```



```text
Question: Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?

Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: How old was Muhammad Ali when he died?
Intermediate answer: Muhammad Ali was 74 years old when he died.
Follow up: How old was Alan Turing when he died?
Intermediate answer: Alan Turing was 41 years old when he died.
So the final answer is: Muhammad Ali


Question: When was the founder of craigslist born?

Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who was the founder of craigslist?
Intermediate answer: Craigslist was founded by Craig Newmark.
Follow up: When was Craig Newmark born?
Intermediate answer: Craig Newmark was born on December 6, 1952.
So the final answer is: December 6, 1952


Question: Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?

Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?
Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.
Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.
So the final answer is: Joseph Ball


Question: Are both the directors of Jaws and Casino Royale from the same country?

Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who is the director of Jaws?
Intermediate Answer: The director of Jaws is Steven Spielberg.
Follow up: Where is Steven Spielberg from?
Intermediate Answer: The United States.
Follow up: Who is the director of Casino Royale?
Intermediate Answer: The director of Casino Royale is Martin Campbell.
Follow up: Where is Martin Campbell from?
Intermediate Answer: New Zealand.
So the final answer is: No


Question: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
```

## Using an example selector

### Feed examples into `ExampleSelector`

我们将继续使用上一节中的示例集和格式化程序。但是，我们将示例直接输入到`FewShotPromptTemplate`对象，而是将它们输入到`ExampleSelector`对象中。
在本教程中，我们将使用`SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector`类。该类根据它们与输入的相似性选择几个示例。它使用嵌入模型计算输入和几个示例之间的相似性，以及矢量存储来执行最近邻搜索。

```python
from langchain.prompts.example_selector import SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

example_selector = SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector.from_examples(
    # This is the list of examples available to select from.
    examples,
    # This is the embedding class used to produce embeddings which are used to measure semantic similarity.
    OpenAIEmbeddings(),
    # This is the VectorStore class that is used to store the embeddings and do a similarity search over.
    Chroma,
    # This is the number of examples to produce.
    k=1,
)

# Select the most similar example to the input.
question = "Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?"
selected_examples = example_selector.select_examples({"question": question})
print(f"Examples most similar to the input: {question}")
for example in selected_examples:
    print("\n")
    for k, v in example.items():
        print(f"{k}: {v}")
```



```text
Examples most similar to the input: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?


answer: 
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?
Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.
Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.
So the final answer is: Joseph Ball

question: Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?
```



### Feed example selector into `FewShotPromptTemplate`

Finally, create a `FewShotPromptTemplate` object. This object takes in the example selector and the formatter for the few-shot examples.

```python
prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
    example_selector=example_selector,
    example_prompt=example_prompt,
    suffix="Question: {input}",
    input_variables=["input"],
)

print(prompt.format(input="Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?"))
```



```text
Question: Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?

Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?
Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.
Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.
So the final answer is: Joseph Ball


Question: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
