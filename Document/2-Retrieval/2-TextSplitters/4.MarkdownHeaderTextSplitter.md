# MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter

### Motivation

Many chat or Q+A applications involve chunking input documents prior to embedding and vector storage.

[These notes](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/chunking-strategies/) from Pinecone provide some useful tips:

```text
When a full paragraph or document is embedded, the embedding process considers both the overall context and the relationships between the sentences and phrases within the text. This can result in a more comprehensive vector representation that captures the broader meaning and themes of the text.
```



As mentioned, chunking often aims to keep text with common context together. With this in mind, we might want to specifically honor the structure of the document itself. For example, a markdown file is organized by headers. Creating chunks within specific header groups is an intuitive idea. To address this challenge, we can use `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter`. This will split a markdown file by a specified set of headers.

For example, if we want to split this markdown:

```text
md = '# Foo\n\n ## Bar\n\nHi this is Jim  \nHi this is Joe\n\n ## Baz\n\n Hi this is Molly' 
```



We can specify the headers to split on:

```text
[("#", "Header 1"),("##", "Header 2")]
```



And content is grouped or split by common headers:

```text
{'content': 'Hi this is Jim  \nHi this is Joe', 'metadata': {'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Bar'}}
{'content': 'Hi this is Molly', 'metadata': {'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Baz'}}
```



Let’s have a look at some examples below.

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter
```



```python
markdown_document = "# Foo\n\n    ## Bar\n\nHi this is Jim\n\nHi this is Joe\n\n ### Boo \n\n Hi this is Lance \n\n ## Baz\n\n Hi this is Molly"

headers_to_split_on = [
    ("#", "Header 1"),
    ("##", "Header 2"),
    ("###", "Header 3"),
]

markdown_splitter = MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter(headers_to_split_on=headers_to_split_on)
md_header_splits = markdown_splitter.split_text(markdown_document)
md_header_splits
```



```text
[Document(page_content='Hi this is Jim  \nHi this is Joe', metadata={'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Bar'}),
 Document(page_content='Hi this is Lance', metadata={'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Bar', 'Header 3': 'Boo'}),
 Document(page_content='Hi this is Molly', metadata={'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Baz'})]
```



```python
type(md_header_splits[0])
```



```text
langchain.schema.document.Document
```



By default, `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter` strips headers being split on from the output chunk’s content. This can be disabled by setting `strip_headers = False`.

```python
markdown_splitter = MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter(
    headers_to_split_on=headers_to_split_on, strip_headers=False
)
md_header_splits = markdown_splitter.split_text(markdown_document)
md_header_splits
```



```text
[Document(page_content='# Foo  \n## Bar  \nHi this is Jim  \nHi this is Joe', metadata={'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Bar'}),
 Document(page_content='### Boo  \nHi this is Lance', metadata={'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Bar', 'Header 3': 'Boo'}),
 Document(page_content='## Baz  \nHi this is Molly', metadata={'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Baz'})]
```



Within each markdown group we can then apply any text splitter we want.

```python
markdown_document = "# Intro \n\n    ## History \n\n Markdown[9] is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form.[9] \n\n Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files. \n\n ## Rise and divergence \n\n As Markdown popularity grew rapidly, many Markdown implementations appeared, driven mostly by the need for \n\n additional features such as tables, footnotes, definition lists,[note 1] and Markdown inside HTML blocks. \n\n #### Standardization \n\n From 2012, a group of people, including Jeff Atwood and John MacFarlane, launched what Atwood characterised as a standardisation effort. \n\n ## Implementations \n\n Implementations of Markdown are available for over a dozen programming languages."

headers_to_split_on = [
    ("#", "Header 1"),
    ("##", "Header 2"),
]

# MD splits
markdown_splitter = MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter(
    headers_to_split_on=headers_to_split_on, strip_headers=False
)
md_header_splits = markdown_splitter.split_text(markdown_document)

# Char-level splits
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

chunk_size = 250
chunk_overlap = 30
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=chunk_size, chunk_overlap=chunk_overlap
)

# Split
splits = text_splitter.split_documents(md_header_splits)
splits
```
